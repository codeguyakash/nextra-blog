## **Who am I 🧑💻:**

### Hey, My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/codeguyakash" >Akash</a>. I'm a Software Development Engineer.

- I have been a `` Frontend Web developer `` since 2020, and I love React. I didn't even know what React was when I landed my first job, but once I discovered it, I immediately fell in love.
- ``💡 Specialization:`` JavaScript & React, JavaScript is my playground, and React is my go-to toolkit. I believe in the power of user-friendly interfaces and seamless user experiences.
- 📚 I'm currently learning ``Full Stack Development``.
